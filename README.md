# Timm Tools : SBSE source code (in Python)

## About this Site

+ 10% **theory** of model-based and search-based SE;
+ 10% **intro Python** examples;
+ 20% how to **build** models (using Python DSLs, using raw programming, uses interfaces to other systems);
+ 40% how to **search** models (multi-objective optimization, plus some data mining);
+ 20% how to **watch** model output (statistical methods for incrementally assessing models).

## Before you start  

Time to freshen your Python skills:

+ Do you understand my [intro Python examples](doc/101python.md)? 
+ Note that some of the techniques in the intro are reused (extensively) in the rest of this code base.
