# Timm's Search-based Tools (in Python)

["_There are some who call me... Tim?_"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTbrIo1p-So)

## Under Construction

This site will be a "howto" guide on combine SBSE and data mining tools
to explore models. Right now, its much less than that. But it will be the
toolkit used for the Fall 2015 graduate subject _Automated
(Model-Based) Software Engineering_.
Share and enjoy... but not quite yet.

## Contents


+ 10% **intro Python** examples;
+ 20% **theory** of model-based and search-based SE;
+ 20% how to **build** models (using Python DSLs, using raw programming, uses interfaces to other systems);
+ 30% how to **search** models (multi-objective optimization, plus some data mining);
+ 20% how to **watch** model output (experimental methods to understanding models).

Also, this site contains [links to example models](doc/examplemodels.md).

## Before you start  

Time to freshen your Python skills:

+ Do you understand my [intro Python examples](doc/101python.md)? 
+ Note that some of the techniques in the intro are reused (extensively) in the rest of this code base.
