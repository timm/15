This site is a "howto" guide on combine SBSE and data mining tools to explore
models. It is/was written Summer 2015 for 
<em>Automated (Model-Based) Software Engineering</em>, an CS NcState graduate class. Share and enjoy.
</td></tr></table>

This site comprises:

+ 10% **intro Python** examples;
+ 20% **theory** of model-based and search-based SE;
+ 20% how to **build** models (using Python DSLs, using raw programming, uses interfaces to other systems);
+ 30% how to **search** models (multi-objective optimization, plus some data mining);
+ 20% how to **watch** model output (experimental methods to understanding models).

Also, this site contains [links to example models](doc/examplemodels.md).

## Before you start  

Time to freshen your Python skills:

+ Do you understand my [intro Python examples](doc/101python.md)? 
+ Note that some of the techniques in the intro are reused (extensively) in the rest of this code base.
